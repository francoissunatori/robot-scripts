# robot-scripts

- This is meant as a series of scripts to lighten the workflow for team_robot.
- In order to work as expected, this repo should live under the same directory as all the other robot team's repos.
- Currently, it's assumed that this repo and all the other robot team's repos are under `~/Documents`
- In order to have control over the use of local packages/servers, add a `config` file in this directory with the
  ```
  <name of the repo (- become _)>=local
  ```
